## Description
I built a test project using Nex.js + Tailwind CSS.

The application is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com)

- For the data I used a json file attatch to the Email.

• I displayed “cards” on the board, similar to the pic in the PDF file

• The X-Axis represents the Time (“Due Date” specifies right border of card and “Estimation” specifies it’s width) : I couldn't complete this part but I'm working on it.

• In Y-Axis displaying only  “Epics” issue type and  “Roadmap” lable. 

• Each card has a Key, Summary, Description, Estimation, Due Date.
